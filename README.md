🌱 Plant Nursery Simulator

A sophisticated C++ simulation of a plant nursery management system, developed for the COS 214 final project at the University of Pretoria. This project demonstrates the practical application of various software design patterns to build a flexible, maintainable, and scalable system.

🌿 Key Features

Dynamic Plant Management: Create, track, and manage a diverse range of plants using the Prototype and Factory patterns.

Advanced Care Routines: Apply different watering and fertilizing schedules to plants at runtime using the Strategy pattern.

Hierarchical Greenhouse Structure: Organize plants into beds and larger greenhouse units with the Composite pattern, allowing for uniform care operations.

Automated Staff Alerts: Staff are automatically notified when plants need care via the Observer pattern.

Decoupled Communication: Staff and Customers interact through a central Mediator, reducing system complexity.

Task-Based Actions: All care actions are encapsulated as Command objects, allowing for queuing and extensibility.

Flexible Data Loading: Load inventory from various file formats (TXT, CSV) using the Adapter pattern.

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to compile and run the simulation on your local machine.

Prerequisites

A C++ compiler that supports C++11 (e.g., GCC)

make build automation tool

Installation & Compilation

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/plant-nursery-simulator.git](https://github.com/your-username/plant-nursery-simulator.git)
cd plant-nursery-simulator


Build the project:
From the root directory, run the make command. This will compile the source files and create an executable in the build/ directory.

make


Running the Simulation

Execute the compiled program from the root directory:

./build/nursery_sim
