# 🌿 Plant Palace

A sophisticated C++ simulation of a plant nursery management system, developed for the **COS 214 final project** at the **University of Pretoria**. This project demonstrates the practical application of various **software design patterns** to build a flexible, maintainable, and scalable system.

---

## 🌿 Key Features

- **Dynamic Plant Management** – Create, track, and manage a diverse range of plants using the **Prototype** and **Factory** patterns.  

- **Advanced Care Routines** – Apply different watering and fertilizing schedules at runtime using the **Strategy** pattern.  

- **Hierarchical Greenhouse Structure** – Organize plants into beds and larger greenhouse units with the **Composite** pattern for uniform care operations.  

- **Automated Staff Alerts** – Staff are automatically notified when plants need care via the **Observer** pattern.  

- **Decoupled Communication** – Staff and Customers interact through a central **Mediator**, reducing system complexity.  

- **Task-Based Actions** – All care actions are encapsulated as **Command** objects, allowing for queuing and extensibility.  

- **Flexible Data Loading** – Load inventory from various file formats (TXT, CSV) using the **Adapter** pattern.
